<h1 style="text-align:center;color:red;"><em>Welcome to Alpha Omega Campus Ministry's Home Page!</em></h1>
<h2 style="font-size:160%;"><br>We are a campus ministry here at UGA and in fellowship with the Alpha Omega Campus Ministry's throughout the U.S. and the World</h2>
<p><br><b><i>Alpha Omega is a campus ministry devoted to laying our lives down for Christ and reaching as many as possible on our campuses during this critical stage of life. 
We know that a fulfilling life and eternal salvation hinge on making Jesus the Lord of our lives.
We also know that the radical life of Christianity is a race of perseverance in which our enthusiasm for Christ should last for a lifetime.
Therefore, Alpha Omega seeks to help its members develop deep life-long convictions that are based solidly in the Word of God.
We also strive to help students make lasting family relationships within the church at the Athens Church of Christ to encourage their perseverance.
<abbr title="Alpha Omega Campus Ministry">AO</abbr> have multiple events throughout the week to help build the unity among the group.
These events are attending church at the Athens Church of Christ, attending Midweek on Tuesday nights, small Bible discussions during weekday nights,and fun hangouts on the weekend.
Alpha Omega's mission is to love God and to love the people we encounter.</i></b></p>
<p style="color:red;font-size:18px;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;"><br>
<strong>We love visitors so come out and join our big family on Tuesday nights at 7 at the Miller Learning Center!</strong></p>
